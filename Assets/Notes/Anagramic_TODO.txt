Draggable tiles
Tiles move toward target
Build static racks
Build static slots
Add tile click
Do tiles know what the racks are?

For a tile to move to a new rack on click, it will need to be able to call the AddTileToFirstEmptySlot on a rack object.  Could use SendMessageUpwards instead

Should just build two static Racks and static slots.  No need to be generated at run time.
