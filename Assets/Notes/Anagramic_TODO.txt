Anagramic TODO


Shuffle doesn't use target
Click to add doesn't move using target
Check for collisions
Set target based on collisions


Should setting the target slot act in the same way.  Send message upwards, let the the racks figure out what the tile target is.

Make singleton game manager
When a tile is clicked, it escalates to game manager, who handles the placement

On tap, goto parent, parent and then sibling rack.  Add to first empty spot.

For a tile to move to a new rack on click, it will need to be able to call the AddTileToFirstEmptySlot on a rack object.  Could use SendMessageUpwards instead

Should just build two static Racks and static slots.  No need to be generated at run time.

Build static racks
Build static slots
Draggable tiles
Tiles move toward target
Add tile click
Do tiles know what the racks are?
